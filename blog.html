    <p>With the current interest in healthy, plant-based foods and beverages, many consumers are turning to herbal teas as an alternative to sugary beverages. But, if you’re switching to drinking tea for health reasons, you may be wondering, does herbal tea have caffeine?

        I’m a huge tea drinker, but not a fan of caffeine. I’m already a morning person, so I don’t need a big jolt to get me going when I wake up. But, I do like to sit with a warm beverage every morning while I read and relax before work, and caffeine-free herbal tea has been my go-to for many years. (Specifically peppermint, if you’re curious.)
        
        Most herbal teas don’t contain caffeine, but there are some exceptions. First, I’ll share information about herbal teas that do have caffeine, then we’ll dive into your caffeine-free alternatives, including the best ones to grow in your garden.

        When you get a whiff of fresh basil, what comes to mind? If you answered, summer, I’m right with you! Basil is up there with tomatoes and watermelon as one of the signature tastes of the summer season.
        
        I think basil is one of the most worth it plants to grow in the garden because once it gets going you can return to the plants again and again for harvesting. But, the key to continual harvests is –  you don’t want your basil plant flowering.
        
        Luckily, that’s a pretty simple task if you know exactly how to harvest basil to encourage the plant to keep growing it’s tasty little leaves. Let’s dive in and learn some simple steps to take!
        If you’re reading this article, I’m going to assume you’re not in the “cilantro tastes like dirty socks” category of people. Whew! Me neither.

        In fact, I love eating and growing cilantro, probably because tacos are one of my favorite quick weeknight dinners.  And IMHO, no one should eat a taco without sprinkling some chopped cilantro on top as the finisher.
        
        Unfortunately, I hear from lots of gardeners who tell me that cilantro is a tricky plant to grow.
        
        And I agree.
        
        There are lots of reasons for that, mostly tied to the fact that cilantro is picky about the conditions in which it grows. Cilantro bolting is a very common occurrence in vegetable gardens everywhere during late spring and early summer.
        
        And while you can’t keep you cilantro alive forever, knowing the best tips for watering cilantro will go a long way towards helping it live as long as possible, i.e. for many weeks of Taco Tuesdays!
